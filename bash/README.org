DOT BASH

This area sets up the interactive bash session for all accounts.

* Installation

Run ../install.sh in a new account.  It creates .bash_login,
.bash_logout and .bashrc as symlinks to files of the same, non-dotted
names in this directory.  If any of these files exists, they will be
moved asside.  If .profile or .bash_profile exist they will be moved
aside.

* How it works

The usual rc files will load all relevant configuration chunks found
under

#+begin_src shell
~/dot/bash/{login,logout,rc}/DIR/*
#+end_src

Where =DIR= is expanded in turn to to be the string "any", followed by

#+begin_src shell
uname -s             # Kernel name (Linux)
lsb_release -s -i    # Distribution name (Ubuntu, Debian)
lsb_release -s -c    # Distribution codename (maverik, squeeze)
hostname -d          # Domain name
uname -n             # Hostname
#+end_src

Interactive logins first source =~/.bashrc= followed by any relevant
chunks under =login/=.

Individual script chunks can make use of functions defined in 

#+begin_src shell
~/dot/bash/common.sh
~/dot/bash/common/*
#+end_src

My "dot" files.

This repo attempts to get control of what has historically been my
chaotic configuration files.  It is meant to be usable in every one of
my accounts.  This README keeps some notes for myself.

* Installation

Run ./install.sh 

* bash

Break things up in two dimensions:

 * by login/rc/logout 

 * by Kernel, architecture, distributor, distribution codename,
   domain, subdomain, host

* emacs

Want to break things up like in bash, but my elisp skills are lacking.

Rely on el-get to provide some packages.  See el-get-install.el.

* mail

Mail = GNUS + OfflineIMAP + notmuch + dovecot + postfix + SSH

Postfix sends mail out to a port forwarded via ssh to a smarthost.
OfflineIMAP syncs to primary server via port foraded via ssh.

* gstm

SSH tunnel manager configurations.
